## Single step

Always aim for a single step experience.

By design, `@atlaskit/spotlight` does not have a blanket, scroll-lock, or focus-trap functionality.
This is to ensure the user is not hijacked into the spotlight experience, and can opt-in if they are
interested.

To show/hide the `SpotlightCard`, simply use a `useState` to control the `isVisible` prop on
`PopoverContent`. To position the `SpotlightCard`, use `PopoverProvider`, `PopoverTarget` and
`PopoverContent` and set the `placement` prop.

<Example Component={SingleStepExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />

## Multi-step tour

Multiple steps should be avoided if possible, but if they are required, manage the tour with a
`useState`. If `useState` is not feasible, then a React context may be used. However, these contexts
will often need to be wrapping the entire `App` and therefore will cause the entire `App` to
re-render every time a new spotlight step is shown.

<Example Component={MultipleStepsExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />

## Placements

Spotlight placements are static. They do not change as the user scrolls, or if the `PopoverContent`
overflows out of the viewport. Make sure to choose a placement that ensures the `SpotlightCard` is
displayed in full.

<Example Component={PlacementsExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />

## Media

Media is optional for a `SpotlightCard`and should only be used for more complex features. To ensure
correct reflow on smaller viewports, media must be 295px width X 135px height.

Media can be an image, gif, or video that helps communicate spotlight intent.

<Example Component={MediaExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />

## Controls

`SpotlightDismissControl` is required for all `SpotlightCard` components. It **must** be the first
focusable element on the `SpotlightCard` card to provide an accessible experience.

## Motion

`@atlaskit/spotlight` can be composed with `@atlaskit/motion` or other CSS animation packages to
create smooth 'enter' or 'exit' transitions.

<Example Component={MotionExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />

## Action links

When the primary or secondary control should navigate to a URL instead of performing an action, use
`SpotlightPrimaryLink` and `SpotlightSecondaryLink`. They mirror the appearance of
`SpotlightPrimaryAction` and `SpotlightSecondaryAction` but render as links (e.g. "Get started",
"Learn more").

<Example Component={ActionLinksExample} packageName="@atlaskit/spotlight" />
