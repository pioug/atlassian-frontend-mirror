## Guiding principles

<!-- Need to review this section with Jesse/others
TODO: possibly reword a couple of these and link to relevant other content (i.e. link to visual cues from "clear user feedback", etc.) -->

### 1. Optimise for performance

Pragmatic drag and drop is a performance-oriented drag and drop library that builds upon APIs provided by the browser, allowing for performance gains, asynchronous loading, and package size reductions. Custom add-ons can be created by consumers to extend the native functionality provided by Pragmatic drag and drop. Any undertakings to extend functionality should approach the problem space with performance and optimisation top-of-mind.

### 2. Provide clear user feedback during drag and drop operations

Due to limitations of the browser-provided APIs that underpin this library's implementation, drop targets and visual property changes provide the user with critical real-time feedback during drag operations.

When extending the core library with a custom package, or when alternative visual styling is necessary, it's imperative to provide users with adequate feedback so they understand the result of their actions.

### 3. Create accessible alternative experiences for drag and drop interactions

Unlike some other drag and drop libraries that provide accessible interaction methods out-of-the-box via keyboard and screenreader support, drag and drop's reliance on browser-provided APIs precludes us from providing a similar level of support.

After investigating our options and reviewing with the Accessibility Team, we've created a guide to help you craft alternative experiences that champion equality. Where possible, our recommendations leverage Atlassian Design System components which have been created with accessible standards in mind.

## Anatomy and definitions

### Draggable elements

A DOM node that can be picked up, moved, and dropped over drop targets to perform sorting and moving operations.

### Drag source

Upon drag, the draggable item stays in its original position and its visual properties change to reflect that it is in a disabled state. In this state, the draggable object is known as the drag source.

We recommend updating the visual properties of drag source content into a disabled state using color tokens. [Link to relevant colour tokens docs]. In addition, reducing the opacity of the draggable source helps to shift focus onto the drag preview that is dragged by the user.

### Drag preview

Upon drag, the browser renders a static image of the draggable object which is removed from the normal document flow and is positioned relative to the pointer so it can be dragged by the user. Once the drag preview has been dropped on a valid drop target by the user, the draggable source is removed from its original location and rendered in its updated position.

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">

Due to limitations of the platform APIs that underpin Pragmatic drag and drop, the drag preview generated by the browser prevents the customisation of cursor, opacity, and box-shadow properties. Unfortunately, we cannot inspect the drag preview to provide you with these default properties as the drag preview is rendered outside of the DOM.

Other visual properties can be modified using a workaround method [link to guide once it exists].

### Drop target

Drop targets are containers that draggable elements can be dropped on.

`isOver=['false'|'true']`

The appearance of a drop target can be modified in response to a draggable object being dragged over a drop target to provide the user with visual feedback.

### Sortable list or area

A list of draggable objects that can be reordered within a drop target.

### Drop indicator

When reordering draggable items within drop targets, a line is used to denote the intended resting place of the draggable item once the drag operation is completed.

### Edge detection

When a user drags an item to rearrange its order or to move it between drop targets, it's important to communicate the desired resting place of the item throughout the duration of the drag operation.

Pragmatic drag and drop employs an edge detection to understand the positional relationship between draggable objects and drop targets. This positional information is used to provide user feedback through the display of drop indicators for reordering operations, or the change of visual properties when moving items between drop targets.
