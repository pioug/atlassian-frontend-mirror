## Usage

Use the dropdown menu when you have 5-15 items to choose from. They're used for navigation or
command menus, where an action is initiated based on the selection.

Parts of a dropdown menu:

![The control is a button that opens the menu on interaction. The menu opens below the control and contains text labels.](images/dropdown-menu-anatomy.png)

1. **Control:** A button that may contain an icon, or be labeled with text.
1. **Trigger:** Used if the button is labeled with text.
1. **Menu:** Container for links and action items.

Menu items can include both [radio buttons](/components/radio) and
[checkboxes](/components/checkbox).

### Some other uses for dropdown menus

A "more" menu, where the control contains an icon.

For user profiles, where the control is an [avatar](/components/avatar).

## Behavior

In cases where a menu item is longer than the button's text label, the menu will grow to the width
of the longest item listed. However, there is a maximum width specified by the component. If the
menu item exceeds the maximum width, it will be truncated. Avoid truncated labels where possible.

## Accessibility

- Avoid truncated labels wherever possible by checking that they do not exceed the maximum width of
  the component.
- The menu has a focus lock which traps the focus within the menu. If the menu is triggered using
  the keyboard, the first item gets focused on automatically.
- When using a nested menu, limit the menu to two layers wherever possible. Menus with a lot of
  nested layers are difficult to operate.
- When using a dropdown menu inside a modal dialog, use the `shouldRenderToParent` prop. This
  prevents loss of focus and ensures proper voicing by screen reading programs to render content in
  the nearest DOM node to the trigger element instead of `React.Portal`.
- Disabled triggers are not supported - see the
  [general button accessibility guidance](/components/button/usage#accessibility).

## Best practices

- You can use a number of components to give people the ability to select options. See the list of
  related components below for advice on choosing the right one.
- When organizing dropdown menu items, sort the list in a logical order by putting the most selected
  option at the top, if known. Test and refine over time to re-evaluate if all menu items are
  needed.
- For long lists, group related menu items. If including radio buttons and checkboxes as menu items,
  try grouping related actions.
- Grouped items are separated by a short, uppercase title that describes the options in that
  sub-category.

![The example group has the group title "help", followed by the grouped menu items "Online help", "Learn Git", "Keyboard shortcuts", "Bitbucket tutorials", and "Support"](images/dropdown-menu-grouping.png)

1. Group title (not selectable)
2. Grouped menu items

## Content guidelines

- People navigate menus and choose menu items based on their labels, so it’s important that they're
  accurate and informative.
- Use sentence case and write concise labels that clearly indicate the purpose of the selection.
- For action menu items, use verbs and verb phrases to describe the action that occurs when the item
  is chosen (for example, “Move”, “Log time”, or “Hide epic labels”).
- In most cases, links should be nouns. For example, Profile or Keyboard shortcuts.
- Exclude articles in menu items. For example, use "Add flag" instead of "Add a flag".
- Keep menu items to a single line of text.
