- [`f922302ad53`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f922302ad53) - Icons no longer ship with the `focusable` attribute in their glyph exports. This attribute was only required for IE11 support. This is purely a build change and has no effect on user API.

## 21.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#8178](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/pull-requests/8178) [`b9265389fa0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b9265389fa0) - Icon now exposes a base icon via the `@atlaskit/icon/base` entrypoint. This is used in all generated glyphs inside the icon package.
- [`83944ca2cf2`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/83944ca2cf2) - Icon now ships with cjs, esm, and es2019 bundles for components and utils exported in the icon package. Glyphs unfortunately aren't included and still only export cjs bundles.
- [`6ef8824baee`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6ef8824baee) - - Icon now uses React.memo() to stop unnecessary re-renders.

  - A bug in the types for icon sizes has been resolved

  This change also includes a number of quality of life fixes as part of lite mode.

  ### Internal changes

  - class components have been changed to functional components
  - styled-components has been removed as a peer dependency
  - @emotion/core has been added a direct dependency, base components now use emotion for styling
  - An internal gradient function `insertDynamicGradientId` has been removed from the runtime
  - Enzyme removed in favour of RTL

  ### Updating tests

  Tests that rely on `enzyme` may have issues with this update.
  We've mostly seen issues with one of the following cases.

  #### Can't find internal react test id

  Because icon is now wrapped in `memo` you won't be able to easily find it.
  This code will fail:

  ```js
  import BookIcon from '@atlaskit/icon/glyph/book';

  <BookIcon />;

  wrapper.find('BookIcon');
  ```

  As a fix you can add memo to the target:

  ```js
  wrapper.find('Memo(BookIcon)');
  ```

  Even better, use the test id.

  ```js
  <BookIcon testId="book-icon" />;

  wrapper.find('[data-testid="book-icon"]');
  ```

  #### Treating the icon as a button

  Icon hasn't had an `onClick` handler since many major versions.
  This code will fail:

  ```js
  const Example = () => <Button testId="test-id" iconBefore={<SomeGlyph />} />;

  // in some teat
  wrapper.find(SomeGlyph).click();
  // OR
  wrapper.find('SomeGlyph').click();
  ```

  As a fix you can target the button instead:

  ```jsx
  wrapper.find('[data-testid="test-id"]').click();
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [`0741b1556f6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0741b1556f6) - All icon glpyhs are now built without inline extends helpers, reducing their bundlesize.
- [`8d6c79b9055`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/8d6c79b9055) - Typedefs of glyphs have been updated to reflect an API change that occured in version 15. For context, `onClick` was removed as a functional prop but it was still supported by the types. This may have resulted in a confusing developer experience although the fundamental behaviour has been consistent since version 15.
