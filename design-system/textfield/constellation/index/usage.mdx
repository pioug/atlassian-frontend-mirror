## Usage

Use text fields in [forms](/patterns/forms) to help people enter, select, and search for text. Text fields are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search, or card.

Common text input types include: usernames, descriptions, URLs, emails, addresses, and plain text searches.

## Anatomy

1. **Label:** Should indicate what sort of information the field requires and is left-aligned directly above the input area.
2. **Placeholder text:** Avoid placeholders when possible. Never use placeholder text to communicate critical information — this is not accessible. Instead, use field labels or helper text to describe the purpose of the field and how to use it. Placeholders can be used for search fields or some short example entries.
3. **Input area:** This is where people enter text.
4. **Helper text:** Gives context about a field's input.

## Best practices

- Place labels directly above the input, and align to the left.

## Content guidelines

- For helper text provide an example or specific syntax for the input, rather than in the input area, so that it's visible after text has been entered. Only use this where clarification is required, and try not to overuse it.
- Field label text above the input area should be short and concise.

## Server

Consult [AUI](https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/forms.html) for implementation details.

## Accessibility

- Avoid using placeholder text whenever possible. Make sure any critical information is communicated either in the field label or using helper text below the field. Search fields or brief examples are the only exceptions where placeholder text is OK.
- To announce errors in helper text area during custom validation (reference to [Custom validation example](https://atlassian.design/components/textfield/examples#custom-validation)):
    - Validate field onBlur.
    - Make sure your error container would have `aria-live` attribute value being explicitly set to `polite` by default.
    - Add `aria-relevant="all" aria-atomic="false"` to error container when field lose focus and remove those when field is focused again.
    - Dynamically manipulate error's text content to trigger live region content changes.
    - Announcement behavior using above techniques in Chrome and Safari:
        1. Chrome announces error message onBlur.
        2. Error message in Safari is being announced both onBlur and on keyup events after first loss of focus.
