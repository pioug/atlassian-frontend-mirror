## Basic

A basic text field. If you use a text field outside of a form component, always use a label and
associate the label to the field properly.

<Example Component={TextFieldBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

## Text field in a form component

You'll often use text fields as a [form field](/components/form/examples#field), which must include
a visible label.

<Example Component={TextFieldForm} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

## Validation

### Native

Validation can display a native error message related to the restrictions of the pattern attribute.
Keep this text as short as possible. Use the [writing guidelines](/content/writing-style) for more
help. For complicated information, provide a link to more information in a new browser tab.

<Example Component={TextFieldFormNativeValidation} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

### Custom

<Example Component={TextFieldFormValidation} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

## Appearance

### Standard

The default text field appearance.

<Example Component={TextFieldAppearanceStandard} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

### Subtle

A text field that's transparent until interaction or error.

<Example Component={TextFieldAppearanceSubtle} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

## Character counter

A character counter field provides real-time feedback about text length as people type, showing how
many characters are remaining or have been exceeded.

Use it when there are constraints on text length, such as database limits, technical requirements,
or design constraints.

[details and examples of character counters](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples#charactercounterfield).

## Elements before and after input

Text fields can include non-interactive elements before and after the input. This is useful for
adding elements like icons into the text field.

Don’t nest interactive elements in the text field, as it will cause accessibility and focus issues.

<Example Component={TextFieldElementsBeforeAndAfter} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />

## Customization

Use the data attributes `data-ds--text-field--container` and `data-ds--text-field--input` to
customize the style of the text field container and input element.

<Example Component={TextFieldOverrideStyles} packageName="@atlaskit/textfield" />
