This package contains `react` components to display hitbox information. Hitbox information is usually generated by [`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox`](drag-and-drop/packages/hitbox). These packages use `@emotion/react` for styling.

You do not _need_ to use these packages to display hitbox information, they have been created for your convienance. These packages embody our [design guidelines](/components/drag-and-drop/design-guidelines)

- [`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/box`](/components/drag-and-drop/packages/indicator/box) displays a line relative to a _box_ (eg a `Card`)
- Trees (coming soon)

## Box 

This package provides a `<DropIndicator/>` component to draw drop indicators (lines) relative to box elements (eg `<Card/>`
`)

```ts
import { DropIndicator } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-indicator/box';
```

When performing reordering operations a drop indicator is used to communicate the intended resting place of the `draggable` item. The orientation of the drop indicator should always match the direction of the content flow.

<SectionMessage
  title="Positioning"
>


Ensure that the parent element of the `<DropIndicator/>` has [non-static positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position). The drop indicator uses `position: absolute` so will be positioned relative
to the closest ancestor with non-static positioning.

Generally, you will want to add `position: relative` to the element you want to position the line against.

### Edge 

Use `edge` to specify which edge of the drop target the drop indicator should be rendered on.

<Example Component={ClosestEdgeExample} />

### Gap

Use `gap` to specify the distance between each draggable item.

The line will be drawn at an offset of half this value, resulting in the line being drawn between draggable items.
