  ### What is Embedded Pages?

  An embedded page (EP) is a Confluence page that can be integrated into any 3rd party product. It allows 3rd party product users to natively create/edit/view long-form page content within the same product context that they are working in. This promotes a “more powerful together” product experience and eliminates context-switching between the 3rd party product and Confluence.

  ### Goals of Embedded Pages:

  _1. Deliver value and promote “better together” product experience_ - Allow 3rd party product users to easily create long form content and collaborate/share knowledge within the context of that 3rd party product, and thereby deriving value from this “windowed” experience.

  _2. Eliminate context switching_ - Rather than have users hop over to Confluence to create/edit/view content. We want to bring Confluence pages to you so that users can get started on pages wherever you are.
