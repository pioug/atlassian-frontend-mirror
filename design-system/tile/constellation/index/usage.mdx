## Usage

<SectionMessage appearance="warning">
	Tile should only be used if existing components (e.g.{' '}
	<a href="/components/icon/icon-tile/examples">Icon tile</a>,{' '}
	<a href="/components/object/object-tile/examples">Object tile</a>,{' '}
	<a href="/components/avatar/examples#square">Square Avatars</a>) do not meet your needs.
</SectionMessage>

Tile is a versatile, foundational container with baked in sizing and radii properties for displaying
elements in a tile shape. It is unopinionated in its content and can be used to slot in any asset,
background, color or foreground element as needed.

Both [Icon tile](/components/icon/icon-tile/examples) and
[Object tile](/components/object/object-tile/examples) inherit properties of tile ensuring a
consistent and cohesive tile system across various applications.

Use tiles to slot in elements such as:

- Emojis
- Third-party logos

## Anatomy

<Image src={tileAnatomyLight} srcDark={tileAnatomyDark} alt="Anatomy of a tile" />

1. **Tile background**: By default, the inset variant has a neutral background set to
   <inlineCode>color.background.neutral</inlineCode>. This can be switched out with other background
   tokens, white, or black.
2. **Foreground element**: Place any element within the bounds of the slot.

## Best practices

### Always use the correct variant

- Non-inset variant: suited for full bleed assets as it allows for an end-to-end fill
- Inset variant: use for any other content

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tileVariantDo,
		alt: '',
	}}
>
	Use the same variant when tiles are listed or grouped.
</DoDont>
<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tileVariantDont,
		alt: '',
	}}
>
	Avoid mixing inset and non-inset variables in a group.
</DoDont>

### Reference height of adjacent content for size

Tiles support a range of sizes from 16px to 48px. As a general rule when selecting size, reference
the size of the tile to the height of its adjacent content for visual balance.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: tileReferenceDo,
		alt: '',
	}}
>
	Align tile sizing to closely match the height of its adjacent content.
</DoDont>
<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: tileReferenceDont,
		alt: '',
	}}
>
	Avoid selecting tile sizes smaller than the height of its adjacent content.
</DoDont>
