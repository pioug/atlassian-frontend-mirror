## Default

The menu is a collection of composable menu components intended for use as product wayfinding.

<Example Component={MenuDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />

## Scrollable menu

Menus can be scrollable to fit a fixed height or space.

<Example Component={MenuScrollable} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />

## Scrollable sections

For menus with distinct sections, it's possible to have some scrollable sections.

Scrollable sections don't have as much visual affordance, and should be reserved for user-generated content where the number of menu items isn't known.

<Example Component={MenuScrollableSection} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />

## Loading experience

To defer loading the entire menu, the contents can be rendered as skeleton placeholders while the items load asynchronously.

<Example Component={MenuLoading} packageName="@atlaskit/menu" />
