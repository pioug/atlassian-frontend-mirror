## Using Bleed

Bleed is a component that allows its children to break the boundaries of its container. This is useful for content
that wants to negate the padding or whitespace applied by its parent in a controlled manner. For example in the below grid layout, the middle
item bleeds across the inline and block axes to overlap the gap set by the grid.

<Example Component={BleedAll} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/bleed" />

## Bleed and no bleed

Bleed might be utilised to create a stacking effect with a group of avatars. Here each avatar is laid out with the `Inline` parent
container. Without a bleed, each avatar would sit directly adjacent to its sibling. With `Bleed` we can negate the whitespace and force
each avatar to overlap its direct sibling and create our desired stack.

<Example Component={BleedDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/bleed" />

## Block whitespace

Bleed can be controlled on the block axis (vertical) with the `block` property. The values of this property are tied to our spacing scale.
Note, in the context of a flex container bleed will collapse the whitespace around its child element.

<Example Component={BleedBlock} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/bleed" />

## Inline whitespace

Bleed can also be controlled on the inline axis (horizontal) with the `inline` property. The values of this property are tied to our spacing scale.
Note, in the context of a flex container bleed will collapse the whitespace around its child element.

<Example Component={BleedInline} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/bleed" />
