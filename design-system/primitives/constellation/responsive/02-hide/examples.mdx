### Hide

Using Hide allows you to Hide the children using CSS `display: none` when the viewport size is above a specified breakpoint. By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

Children that are hidden are still rendered into the DOM, so there so there is typically little performance savings — primarily that they are not painted.

<Example
  Component={HideExample}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive"
/>

### Mixing Show and Hide

Prefer using consistent `above` or `below` for readability and consistency.

<Example
  Component={ShowHideExample}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive"
/>
