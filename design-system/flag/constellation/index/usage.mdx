## Usage

Flags appear at the bottom left of the screen and overlay any content.

There are two types of flags: default and bold.

Default flags are for general, event-driven messages that are dismissible. For example, as notifications for recent activity. One common use case for default flags is as a notification about recent activity. This allows people to easily jump into a conversation or activity feed to get a quick update. In these cases, an avatar is used instead of the icon.

Bold flags are not dismissible and use [color](/foundations/color) to reinforce the severity or importance of a message. They are reserved for messages about success, loading, warnings, and errors. They can't be dismissed until the issue is resolved or the message has expired (in the case of a success message). A collapsed and expanded state exists so additional information can be shared.

## Anatomy

1. **Icon (or avatar) and title:** Flags should always contain a concise title and an appropriate [icon](/foundations/iconography), [color](/foundations/color) (or user avatar).
2. **Message (optional):** Flag descriptions are restricted to five lines in length. If the text overflows, it truncates using an ellipsis.
3. **Actions (optional):** A maximum of two links that enable users to act on the flag's content.
4. **Dismiss:** Use to close the flag. This is for default flags only.

## Best Practices

- Use the [color system](/foundations/color) for the usage of flags, and keep a consistent visual language.
- When there are multiple flags, they will stack on top of one another with the most recent flag on top. When a user dismisses a flag, any older flags below will come to the top. Careful consideration should be taken to take into account the ordering and priority of flags in the stack.
- Never use dismissible and non-dismissible flags in a stack. Flags that automatically dismiss will no longer be visible to users.
- When a modal is active, flags should always be visible above the modal.

## Content guidelines

### Information

- Say why it's important.
- Get right to the point.
- Based on the situation, you can add more "wink" to your message, but keep it clear and concise.

### Warning

- Put yourself in the user's shoes.
- Make sure you're not talking about something that has already occurred (this should be an error message instead).

### Error

- Avoid blame and accept if something is our fault - "we're having trouble connecting" rather than "you're having connection issues."
- Let the user know what's causing the error, rather than writing a general error message that works for a number of things.
- Be clear and conversational by thinking about how you might explain a technical error to your non-technical friends.

### Success

- Messages that appear more frequently should have less wink and be more concise.
- Messages that appear after a bigger or more infrequent action can be more playful.
