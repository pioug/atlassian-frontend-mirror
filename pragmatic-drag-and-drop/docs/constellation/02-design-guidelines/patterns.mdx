<!-- Potentially add an intro here, and consider moving a general drag and drop interaction pattern into the "patterns" section. Can link here from there and visaversa... -->

## Boards

From their humble origins in lean manufacturing, Kanban boards have become a ubiquitous drag and drop pattern to help users visualise the state and progress of their work, and is employed in many of Atlassian's products.

A board can be thought of as a group of related lists—known as columns—that contain draggable items. Using drag and drop, users can change the order of items and move them between columns.

### Reordering items in a single column

<figure>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__single-02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    When a user starts dragging an item to reorder it, the drop indicator isn't
    rendered until the item is dragged into a position that would change its
    order.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__single-03.png" />
  <figcaption>
    As the item is dragged into a position that will affect its ordering, edge
    detection is employed to render a drop indicator which signals to the user
    where the item will move to when dropped.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__single-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Once the user lets go of the mouse to end the drag operation, the draggable
    source is removed and the original item is rendered in its new position.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Moving items between boards

<figure>

  <figcaption>A multi-column board in its resting state.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__multiple-02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Similar to single column boards, the drop indicator isn't rendered until the
    item is dragged into a position that would change its order within the
    column, or is dragged over another drop target.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__multiple-03.png" />
  <figcaption>
    To communicate to the user that the item being dragged can be moved to the
    drop target being dragged over, the background changes colour and a drop
    indicator is rendered.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__multiple-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Because the rendering of a drop indicator is dependent on edge detection, it
    isn't currently possible to render a drop target unless there is already an
    item in that drop target. By changing the background colour on hover, the
    user still receives visual feedback to reinforce that the item can be
    dropped on this drop target.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__multiple-05.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Once the user lets go of the mouse to end the drag operation, the draggable
    source is removed and the original item is rendered in its new position.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Reordering boards

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__reorder-02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    When a user starts dragging a column to reorder it, the drop indicator isn't
    rendered until the item is dragged into a position that would change its
    order.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__reorder-03.png" />
  <figcaption>
    As the column is dragged into a position that will affect its ordering, edge
    detection is employed to render a drop indicator which signals to the user
    where the item will move to when dropped.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--board__reorder-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Once the user lets go of the mouse to end the drag operation, the draggable
    source is removed and the column is rendered in its new position.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Grids

Drag and drop can be used to reorder items in a grid. At its core, a grid is a drop target that contains a horizontal list of draggable items. When there's insufficient real estate to show all children on a single line, they wrap over multiple lines.

### Sorting items in a grid

<figure>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--grid-02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    To prevent sending a false signal to the user, the drop indicator isn't rendered until the draggable object is within range of the far edge of the next sibling.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--grid-03.png" />
  <figcaption>
    As the item is dragged into a position that will affect its ordering, edge
    detection is employed to render a drop indicator which signals to the user
    where the item will move to when dropped.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--grid-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    The drop indicator position continues to update as the item is dragged into
    different positions and interacts with different edge boundaries.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--grid-05.png" />
  <figcaption>
    The drop indicator is positioned on the same axis as the content flow. In this example, the grid flows horizontally to wrap over multiple lines and shows the drop indicator positioned between items on the same axis.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--grid-06.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Once the user lets go of the mouse to end the drag operation, the draggable
    source is removed and the original item is rendered in its new position.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Lists

Drag and drop can be used to change the order of items in an ordered list. This is one of the most common usage patterns for drag and drop across Atlassian's product suite.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--list-01.png" />
  <figcaption>Draggable list items in their initial sort order.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--list-02.png" />
  <figcaption>
    To prevent sending false signals to users, the visibility of the drop
    indicator is suppressed until the draggable object is within range of the
    far edge of the next sibling.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--list-03.png" />
  <figcaption>
    As the item is dragged into a position that will affect its ordering, edge
    detection is employed to render a drop indicator which signals to the user
    where the item will move to when dropped.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--list-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    Once the user lets go of the mouse to end the drag operation, the draggable
    source is removed and the original item is rendered in its new position.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Trees

While lists, boards, and grids only allow siblings to be reordered, tree items employ edge detection on both axes to allow users to change the hierarchical relationship between draggable items.

Using Confluence's sidebar as an example of a tree used in an Atlassian product, pages can be:

- Dragged to reorder amongst siblings
- Dragged onto existing pages to create a group, which forms a hierarchical parent-child relationship between pages
- Dragged out of groups to sever existing hierarchical relationships
- Dragged into existing groups to form new hierarchical relationships between parents, and sorting relationships between siblings.

Pragmatic-dnd supports all of the above use cases.

### Drop indicator (with terminal)

Because trees support drag operations that affect hierarchical relationships, drop indicators gain an additional visual affordance to help disambiguate between hierarchical changes. During hierarchical changes, the drop indicator width changes to denote the nesting level. This change can be quite subtle, so to improve the visibility of these changes, the drop indicator gains a terminal which provides a more obvious visual affordance.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--drop-indicator-with-terminal.png" />
  <figcaption>
    The drop indicator terminal draws attention to hierarchical changes as the
    item is dragged and edge detection occurs on the horizontal axis.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Drop target terminal visual properties

| Property           | Value / Token         | Description                |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `height`           | `8px`                 | Terminal height            |
| `width`            | `8px`                 | Terminal width             |
| `border-width`     | `2px`                 | Terminal border width      |
| `border-color`     | `$color.border.brand` | Terminal border color      |
| `border-radius`    | `50%`                 | Terminal radius (rounding) |
| `background-color` | `transparent`         | Terminal background color  |

<figure>
  <img src="/images/example--tree__new-group-04.png" />
  <figcaption>
    As the user drags the tree item on the horizontal axis, edge detection is
    employed to update the drop indicator position to show that the item will
    become a child of the item being dragged over.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
