## Usage

Use a form when you want people to provide and submit relevant information, such as changing
personal settings or creating a work item.

Components that can be used within a form include
[text fields](https://atlassian.design/components/textfield/examples),
[text areas](https://atlassian.design/components/textarea/examples),
[selects](https://atlassian.design/components/select/examples),
[radio buttons](https://atlassian.design/components/radio/examples),
[checkboxes](https://atlassian.design/components/checkbox/examples),
[date and time pickers](https://atlassian.design/components/datetime-picker/date-picker/examples),
[toggles](https://atlassian.design/components/toggle/examples),
[ranges](https://atlassian.design/components/range/examples), and
[buttons](https://atlassian.design/components/button/examples).

## Anatomy

![The anatomy form example has a heading of "Create a project" and it has three fields: Project name, description, and project permissions.](../images/form-anatomy.png)

1. **Title**: Use a short title to explain the form’s intention.
2. **Description** (optional): A short description can be placed after the title.
3. **Required fields legend**: When a form has required fields, always include the legend.
   [View legend wording](#required-fields).
4. **Required fields**: Use a red asterisk after the field label to clearly show it's a required
   field.
5. **Helper text**: Use for information that clarifies the input and helps people fill in the field.
6. **Labels:** Labels are required for all form inputs. Labels should be concise, left-aligned, and
   placed above a form field.
7. **Character counter**: Use when a field has a character limit to show a real-time countdown of
   characters used. View details of the
   [character counter](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples#charactercounterfield).
8. **Form section:** Use sections to group form fields into smaller parts. Include a concise section
   title to describe the group of controls and fields. If needed, add a short description to explain
   the section.
9. **Form footer:** Always use a submit button and distinguish primary and secondary buttons. Read
   about [button placement](#positioning-buttons-in-forms).

## Accessibility guidance for forms

- Autofocus the first field by default. This allows people to tab through elements in the form in a
  logical way.
- Make sure all fields have a visible and accessible label. The only exception to a visible label is
  for a search field, but only when it has a search icon, accessible label, and placeholder.
- Never disable a submit button, even if all of the required fields aren't filled in. Instead,
  describe what needs to be done with clear instructions and
  [validation and error messages](#validation-and-error-messages).
- Use
  [standard HTML autofill tokens](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofilling-form-controls:-the-autocomplete-attribute)
  to reduce typing and user error by letting the browser suggest previously saved information.
- Persist forms on refresh so user data isn’t lost.
- Validate forms inline so people using keyboards don't have to navigate far to get feedback.
- Make interactions and written instructions clear to prevent errors and help people fix problems as
  they occur.
- On mobile, match the keyboard to the input type. For example: if asking for a phone number, bring
  up the numbers keys.

### Avoid placeholder text

- Don’t use placeholder text – it isn’t accessible and won’t be read out by assistive technologies.
- **Exception**: placeholder text can be used in search fields if it’s accompanied by a search icon
  and accessible label. This ensures that people using assistive technologies understand what type
  of field it is.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormPlaceholderDo,
			alt: 'Text field in a formwith helper text saying"Minimum 12 characters. Use a mix of symbols, numbers, and lower and upper case letters.',
		}}
	>
		Use helper text to give information that helps people fill in the field.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormPlaceholderDont,
			alt: 'Text field in a formwith placeholder text saying "Minimum 12 characters".',
		}}
	>
		Don't use placeholder text to give critical information.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

## Layout

The width of a form typically follows the width of where it lives, for example in a modal or page.

Use [form sections](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples#form-section) to group related
fields into logical sections. This helps people better understand the information they need to
enter.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormGroupingDo,
			alt: 'Form example where the fields "Project" and "Work type" are grouped under the subheading "Location and type".',
		}}
	>
		Group related information into form sections.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormGroupingDont,
			alt: 'Form example where the fields are not grouped.',
		}}
	>
		Don't provide a form of unrelated information.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

Use one form column as it’s easier to follow and comprehend. People using screen magnifiers may also
miss content in a second column.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormOneColumnDo,
			alt: 'All form fields are in one column.',
		}}
	>
		Use only one column in a form.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormOneColumnDont,
			alt: 'Form fields spread over two columns',
		}}
	>
		Don't use multiple form columns.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

## Fields and labels

### Fields

- Limit the number of form fields to avoid cognitive load and help people submit the form faster.
- Avoid optional fields by only asking for relevant information.
- Instead of using default selections, use smart defaults where relevant. For example, preselect the
  user's country based on location data.
- The length of a field should reflect the intended length of content. Available lengths are 75px,
  150px, 250px, 350px, and 500px.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormDefaultValuesDo,
			alt: 'Account preferences form with the default language set to English (AU) and time zone set to Australia/Brisbane.',
		}}
	>
		Provide smart default values.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormDefaultValuesDont,
			alt: 'Account preferences form with the default language set to English (AU) and time zone set to Europe/Amsterdam.',
		}}
	>
		Don't give random default values.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormInputMasksDo,
			alt: 'The password field is obscured by an input mask.',
		}}
	>
		Use input masks to help users understand correct field formats.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormInputMasksDont,
			alt: 'The password field shows plain text while typing.',
		}}
	>
		Don’t use default inputs for particular fields.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

### Required fields

When a form has required fields, always include a legend at the top of the form and add an asterisk
after the field label.

- Legend wording must be: 'Required fields are marked with an asterisk \*'
- If a form has a description, place the legend after the description.
- Use a red asterisk (\*) after the field label to clearly show which fields are required.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormRequiredFieldDo,
			alt: 'A form that has the required field legend under its header.',
		}}
	>
		Always include the legend: Required fields are marked with an asterisk *.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormRequiredFieldDont,
			alt: 'A form that has asterisks (*) next to field labels but without a legend.',
		}}
	>
		Don’t forget the legend and only mark a required field with an asterisk (*).
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

### Labels

- Always include a visible label with an input field.
- The only exception is for a search field that has a search icon, accessible label, and placeholder
  text.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormVisibleLabelDo,
			alt: 'Two text fields in a form show a visible label above them.',
		}}
	>
		Always include a visible label.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormVisibleLabelDont,
			alt: 'Two form text fields have inaccessibleplaceholder text inside them',
		}}
	>
		Don’t use placeholder text instead of a visible label.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

Write concise labels and avoid using verbs.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormConciseLabelDo,
			alt: 'The visible label uses a noun "Description"',
		}}
	>
		Describe the field.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormConciseLabelDont,
			alt: 'The visible label uses a verb before the noun "Add a description".',
		}}
	>
		Don’t use a verb or action in a label.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

## Buttons

- Use a primary button for the main action. Then, if required, use a standard or a link button.
- Use a link button for a 'cancel' action.
- The button label should state the action the button performs when selected.

Avoid multiple action buttons and reset buttons. This will reduce confusion about how to submit the
form.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDo,
			alt: 'Form with a single primary "Create" button and a secondary "Cancel" button.',
		}}
	>
		Use clear, binary actions in button labels.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormMultipleActionButtonsDont,
			alt: 'Form with a single primary "Create" button, a secondary "Manage trials" button and a subtle "Cancel" button.',
		}}
	>
		Don't use multiple action buttons and a cancel button in the footer of a form.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

Ensure the primary action button provides feedback that the form is being submitted.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormButtonFeedbackDo,
			alt: 'Form where the "Create" button is replaced by a spinner.',
		}}
	>
		Give feedback, like a spinner, to show the form is being submitted.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormButtonFeedbackDont,
			alt: 'Form where the "Create" button remains the same and shows no feedback.',
		}}
	>
		Don't let the user question whether their action might not have worked.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

The button’s label should reflect the action in the heading.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: FormReflectActionDo,
			alt: 'Form heading and button both give "log in" as the action.',
		}}
	>
		If your form has an action (verb) in the heading, use the same action in the button label.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: FormReflectActionDont,
			alt: 'Form heading says "log in" but the button says "Submit".',
		}}
	>
		Don’t show a different action in the button label. Align it with the form’s heading.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

### Positioning buttons in forms

How buttons are aligned depends on the type of form you’re designing. For detailed guidance on
button positioning, view
[button alignment and positioning](https://atlassian.design/components/button/usage#alignment-and-positioning).

## Character counter

A character counter shows people how many characters can be entered into a text field or text area.
It provides real-time feedback on characters used and remaining.

A counter can be set to show a maximum length, minimum length, and both a minimum and maximum
length. View an
[interactive example of character counter](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples#charactercounterfield).

### Maximum length

Use to set a maximum number of characters for a field.

![A field with a character counter showing the maximum number of characters that can be entered.](../images/character-counter-max.png)

### Minimum length

Use for setting a minimum number of characters on a text field or field label.

![A field with a character counter showing the minimum number of characters that can be entered.](../images/character-counter-min.png)

### Minimum and maximum length

Use when your field has both a minimum and maximum character count.

![A field with a character counter showing both the minimum and maximum number of characters that can be entered.](../images/character-counter-min-max.png)

1. **Minimum length** - the first message shows the minimum number of characters that can be
   entered.
2. **Maximum length** - When the minimum character length has been met, the second message displays
   the maximum number of characters that can be entered.

### Helper text placement

The placement of helper text differs on a character counter to allow for the counter to update in
real time. It is designed to sit under the label of a text field or text area.

## Validation and error messages

Use validation and error messages to indicate when a form or field submission fails or requires
additional information to be shown.

![Form validation example showing error messaging placement below each field and the use of red to highlight an unfocused text field that needs an entry.](../images/form-validation.png)

1. Unfocused text field
2. Error message and icon
3. Focused text field

The focus color changes to blue when a user selects the text field and starts typing or changes
content.

When validating text fields in real-time, a warning or error icon will appear when the content
entered doesn't fit the criteria. If there’s helper text in text fields or text areas, it will be
replaced by a warning or error message.

Error and warning messages disappear when the criteria is met.

## Long forms

When people access a form, it can be daunting to be shown a large number of fields.

While what ‘long’ is depends on audience and context, there are ways to make long forms easier for
people.

- Break up forms into multiple steps.
- Use progressive disclosure.
- Try to only use required fields.

## Multi-step forms

You can spread form fields across more than one screen to make a multi-step form using a
[progress tracker](https://atlassian.design/components/progress-tracker).

- Make sure each screen contains fields that belong together.
- Ensure people know their status at each step of a form and that their progress is saved.

## Progressive disclosure

Use [conditional fields](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples#conditional-fields) to
configure a form to show more content as users fill in its fields.

Use this technique when it isn’t necessary to see all fields unless someone has made a specific
decision. For example, if they tick a particular checkbox, related information would be revealed.

## Related

Numerous input components can be added to a form component. See the individual component pages for
the details of using:
