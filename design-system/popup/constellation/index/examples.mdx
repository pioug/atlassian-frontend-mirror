## Default

This is the simplest form of a popup. The popup opens from a trigger element.

<Example Component={PopupDefaultExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Placement

Use the `placement` prop to set a preferred position (`auto`, `top`, `right`, `left`, or `bottom`).
The popup will move automatically if it's near the edge of the screen.

Using the `auto` placement will place the popup on the side with the most space available.

<Example Component={PopupPlacementExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Multiple

You can use popups multiple times on the same page.

<Example Component={PopupMultipleExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Nested

Nesting popups inside other popups works out of the box. However, be mindful that nested popups
quickly become confusing, inaccessible, and difficult to navigate. If you’re nesting a lot of
content, it’s time to move your experience to a new page instead.

This example has additional code to prevent the parent popup closing when interacting with the child
popup.

<Example Component={PopupNestedExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Content updates

When changing the content inside the popup, call the `update()` function to reposition the popup.

Make sure to call this in the same callback or update step to ensure everything happens in the same
animation frame.

<Example Component={PopupContentUpdateExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Customization

You can customize the popup using a component override with the `popupComponent` prop.

Make sure to
[forward the ref to the underlying DOM node](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html), or the
positioning of the popup won't work correctly.

<Example Component={PopupCustomExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Focus

### Set focus

You can focus a specific element when opening the popup. The `content` render props provide a ref
`setInitialFocusRef` to be set on the desired element. Only set focus to an element at the start of
the popup, otherwise people who use assistive technology may miss the content.

The specified element needs to be available in the document as soon as the popup is opened,
otherwise it will not be focused upon. This means it will not work for content that renders into the
popup content after it has already opened, such as async or lazy loaded content. In those cases, you
will need to manually set focus on the content once it is rendered.

<Example Component={PopupFocusExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

### Disable autofocus

If an element is focused, setting the `autofocus` prop to `false` will ensure it keeps focus when
the popup is opened.

<Example Component={PopupDisableAutofocusExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Surface detection

The [current surface CSS variable](/components/tokens/code#current-surface-color) is set to the
surface color of the popup. You can use the `utility.elevation.surface.current` design token to
style children with the current surface color.

<Example Component={PopupSurfaceDetectionExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Content wrapping

By default, the popup content is rendered inside `React.Portal`. Use `shouldRenderToParent` prop to
render the content directly after the trigger element.

<Example Component={PopupContentWithoutPortalExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Role

Use the `role` prop to set a role for the popup content. We do not forbid passing any of the aria
roles, but we strongly recommend using only `menu` or `dialog`. When the `role="dialog"` property is
passed, one of the following properties must also be added: `label` or `titleId`.

<Example Component={PopupWithRoleExample} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />

## Full width

Use `shouldFitContainer` to fit the popup width to its parent's width. When set to `true`, the
trigger and popup elements will be wrapped in a `div` with `position: relative`. The popup will be
rendered as a sibling to the trigger element, and will be full width.

<Example Component={PopupFullWidth} packageName="@atlaskit/popup" />
