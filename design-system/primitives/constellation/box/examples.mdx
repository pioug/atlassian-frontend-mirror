## Basic

Box is a general-purpose container that allows for controlled use of design tokens. Use the given props to configure display behavior and styling that aligns with the Atlassian Design System.
Use [XCSS](/components/primitives/xcss/usage) to style primitive components safely with tokens.

<Example Component={BoxBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Padding

Use padding props to access spacing design tokens and control internal layout. The following example demonstrates how each prop works with space tokens.

<Example Component={BoxPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

The nomenclature used by these props follows [logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties). This naming is used to support different [writing modes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode) in Atlassian products.

## Background color

Box accepts a wide variety of background colors, referenced as semantic design tokens. For the full list of color tokens, visit the [token list](/components/tokens/all-tokens).

<Example
  Component={BoxBackgroundColor}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box"
/>

## XCSS

Box exposes an `xcss` prop. This prop accepts `xcss` function calls that contain a subset of permitted styles. When used with `Box`, `xcss` accepts most CSS properties, and when a token exists, the rule accepts that token as a value.

For more information on XCSS, see the dedicated [XCSS documentation](/components/primitives/xcss).

<Example Component={BoxXcss} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Conditional styles

To achieve conditional styles, we suggest composing conditional styles via the `props.xcss` API rather than applying conditional behaviour to individual props.

<Example Component={BoxConditional} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Practical card example

Box is designed to be composed with inline, stack, and other components to create layouts.

Atlassian uses dozens of distinct card-like components across products. Therefore, rather than providing a strict component, the Atlassian Design System empowers and supports you to build your own card components in ways that are consistent and will scale over time.

<Example
  Component={BoxPracticalUseCase}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box"
/>
