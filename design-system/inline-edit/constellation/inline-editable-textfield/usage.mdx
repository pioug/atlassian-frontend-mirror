## Usage

Most inline edit use cases use a standard text field. Use an inline editable text field to let users
switch between reading and editing text in a simple [text field](/components/textfield) out of the
box.

Use an [inline edit](/components/inline-edit) if you require more customisation and need to pass in
your own custom input components. Remember to pass in custom read view and edit view components to
match the input components' size.

## Anatomy

### Read view

1. ** Label: ** Labels are concise, sentence case text describing what to enter in the field.

2. ** Text field: ** When in read view, the field is hidden and aligned with the label. When in an
   empty state, you can customise what placeholder text is shown here.

### Edit view

1. ** Label: ** Labels are concise, sentence case text describing what to enter in the field.

2. ** Text field: ** When in edit view, the field snaps to the width of the column and the text
   remains aligned with the label.

3. ** Controls: ** Options to save or cancel the current data entry appear at the end of the field.

## Behavior

The inline editable text field has the same features as [inline edit](/components/inline-edit). This
includes the action buttons and validation features.

## Best practices

Use an inline editable text field for when there is existing content in a text field that may need
to be tweaked.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: inlineEditTextfieldDo,
			alt: 'Inline edit textfields in a side drawer.',
		}}
	>
		Use an inline editable text field for where there are multiple items on a page that can be
		edited at once.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: inlineEditTextfieldDont,
			alt: 'Inline edit textfields in a modal form.',
		}}
	>
		Do not use an inline editable text field if the main function of the screen is editing. Try
		using a text area instead.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>
