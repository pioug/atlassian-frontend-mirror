A drag adapter determines how to handle dragging a specific type of entity, such as elements, files, or pieces of text. 

When you use a drag adapter, you'll only bring in the code required for that entity, which saves space and improves performance. For example, if you use the element adapter, your application won't include any code for handling files.

## How adapters work

A drag adapter always provides at least two pieces:

1. A way of registering a _drop target_ (eg `dropTargetForElements`).
2. A way to create a _monitor_ (eg `monitorForFiles`).

```ts
import {
  dropTargetForFiles,
  monitorForFiles,
} from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/file';

import {
  dropTargetForElements,
  monitorForElements,
} from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element';
```

## Element adapter

The element adapter powers drag operations of elements. 

A drag adapter can also provide additional pieces. For example, the element adapter provides a `draggable` function which is a way of registering an `Element` as being draggable.

```ts
import { draggable } from '@atlaskit/drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = draggable({
  element: myElement,
});
```

## File adapter

The file adapter powers drag operations of external files.
