## Usage

A progress bar shows the duration of a system process, such as saving or processing changes, uploading and downloading files, and loading or updating an application.

Use a progress bar when you can determine the percentage of the completed task at any time.  

## Anatomy

![Progress bar anatomy](/images/progress-bar-anatomy.png)

1. Progress line: The visual representation of the progress.
2. Progress bar container: Determine the length of the bar by the available screen space.

## Best practice

<DoDont
  type="do"
  image={{
    url: progressBarDo,
    alt: 'Atlaskit button that says Reset Password'
  }}
>
  Use the progress bar component as a loading indicator or to communicate the status of a system process.
</DoDont>

<DoDont
  type="dont"
  image={{
    url: progressBarDont,
    alt: 'Atlaskit button that says Click here to choose a password'
  }}
>
  Don't use the progress bar for data visualization. Use a custom component instead.
</DoDont>

## Content guidelines

- Use helper text with a progress bar if the process is complex or has a long wait time. This lets users know what sub-processes are taking place.
- Use a success state when the actions required to continue have been fulfilled.
