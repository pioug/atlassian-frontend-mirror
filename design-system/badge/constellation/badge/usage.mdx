## Usage

Use badges to represent numerical data such as counts and metrics. Leading symbols like additions
(+) and subtractions (-) can be used to indicate change. Trailing letters like day (D), thousand
(K), million (M) can be used to represent abbreviations.

## Anatomy

<Image
	src={badgeAnatomyLight}
	srcDark={badgeAnatomyDark}
	alt="The anatomy of the badge component, showing two examples: one displaying +25 positioned between two numbered items, and another showing 1.3M next to a numbered item"
/>

1. **Label:** Should only contain a numeric value.
2. **Letters or special character (optional):** leading special characters can be used to represent
   additions (+) or subtractions (-), and trailing letters can be used to represent abbreviations (D
   for day, K for thousand, and M for million).

## Color

Badges offer 6 semantic appearances: danger, warning, success, information, discovery, and neutral.
They also include an inverse appearance for use on inverse backgrounds relative to the selected
theme.

<Image
	src={badgeColorLight}
	srcDark={badgeColorDark}
	alt="Seven badge examples showing different semantic colors: -25 in danger (red), 0.5 in warning (orange), +10 in success (green), 2.3K in information (blue), 8 in discovery (purple), 30 in neutral (gray), and 15 in inverse (black/white)"
/>

## Best practices

### Apply the correct semantics

Ensure you use the correct semantic appearance for your particular use case to ensure consistency
across apps. Each semantic represents a specific intent — for example, danger represents deletion,
removal, or critical information. Using a semantic appearance that doesn’t represent the information
being conveyed can cause confusion for users and create inconsistent experiences across apps.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: badgeDo1Light,
			urlDarkMode: badgeDo1Dark,
			alt: 'Badge showing -10 with danger appearance (red)',
		}}
	>
		Use the correct semantic color for your use case.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: badgeDont1Light,
			urlDarkMode: badgeDont1Dark,
			alt: 'Badge showing -10 with information appearance (blue)',
		}}
	>
		Don't deviate from established semantics.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

### Provide additional cues to avoid ambiguity

Use badges alongside a label to clearly show which item is quantified. If a badge stands alone, add
a tooltip on hover for context.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: badgeDo2Light,
			urlDarkMode: badgeDo2Dark,
			alt: 'Badges displayed alongside labels in a tab navigation, showing About and Updates with a badge showing 13',
		}}
	>
		Use badges alongside labels or with single items.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: badgeDont2Light,
			urlDarkMode: badgeDont2Dark,
			alt: 'Multiple badges shown together without context: 13, 8, and 15',
		}}
	>
		Don't use badges without context, unless they contain an attached tooltip.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

## Accessibility

- Badges should include tooltips where necessary to enhance user understanding.
- Number values are grouped and separated differently across countries and regions. Use your app's
  internationalization library, or the browser's internationalization features. Make sure the user's
  locale is set correctly so numbers display in a familiar format.

## Data Center products

For all new features, we recommend using Atlassian Design System and other
[Atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). For existing code, you can continue to use
[Atlassian User Interface (AUI)](https://aui.atlassian.com/).
