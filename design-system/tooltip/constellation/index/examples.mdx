## Default

Use the default tooltip to display brief, helpful information when a person hovers over a target
element. The default tooltip will:

- appear and disappear after a short delay.
- remain visible if someone briefly moves their mouse off and back onto the target.
- disappear immediately if someone hovers over or focuses on another element with a tooltip, or if
  they scroll the page.

Tooltip content will wrap at 240px to maintain readability.

<Example Component={TooltipDefault} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## With keyboard shortcut

Use the `shortcut` prop to display a keyboard shortcut in the tooltip. Keys will be displayed as
individual keyboard key segments below the tooltip content.

Keyboard shortcuts in tooltips are hidden from screen readers, so always provide them in another
way, such as a panel or dialog. This ensures everyone can discover and use shortcuts, no matter how
they navigate.

<Example Component={TooltipKeyboardShortcutExample} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## Positioning

### Relative to target

Use the `position` prop to specify where the tooltip appears relative to its target: `top`, `right`,
`left`, or `bottom`.

- Set `position="auto"` so the tooltip automatically shows on the side with the most available
  space.
- If you don’t set a position, the tooltip defaults to `bottom`.
- If the preferred side would cause it to overflow the screen, the tooltip will automatically adjust
  its position.

<Example Component={TooltipPosition} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

### Relative to mouse pointer

Positioning the tooltip near the mouse pointer, rather than the target, is helpful in scenarios
where the tooltip may be visually disconnected from where someone hovers.

Examples include hovering on large target areas, such as panel resizers, or when someone hovers on
an element while zoomed in on part of the screen where the tooltip doesn’t show.

- To display the tooltip next to the mouse pointer (instead of the target element), set
  `position="mouse"`.
- Further adjust the tooltip’s placement relative to the mouse by using the `mousePosition`
  property.
- For keyboard users, the tooltip will always appear below (`bottom` position) the target element by
  default.

<Example Component={TooltipPositionMouse} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

### Updating tooltip position

When the content of a tooltip changes due to lazy loading, its position isn't recalculated and the
tooltip may become misaligned.

If you need the tooltip to recalculate its position, you can control this manually using the
`update` callback provided to the `content` render prop.

<Example Component={TooltipUpdate} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## Conditional tooltips for truncation

A tooltip can be conditionally shown by leveraging the `canAppear` prop. Use when you want the
tooltip to only show when the element content is truncated.

<Example Component={TooltipConditional} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## Ignoring pointer events

In some cases, a tooltip can get in the way if it stays visible when you move your mouse over it,
making it hard to interact with elements underneath or nearby.

To avoid this, set the `ignoreTooltipPointerEvents` prop to true. This makes the tooltip ignore
mouse interactions, so users can easily interact with other elements on the page. This works by
applying `pointer-events: none` to the tooltip.

<Example Component={TooltipPreventInteractions} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## Customizing tooltip

Use the `component` prop to customize the look and feel of the tooltip. The `TooltipPrimitive`
component can be used as a base.

Never put links or other interactive elements in tooltips. Tooltips are not accessible to keyboard
navigation, so users cannot tab into or interact with these elements, making them inaccessible.

<Example Component={TooltipCustomization} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

## Accessibility

### Screen reader support

To make tooltip content accessible to screen readers, the tooltip component creates a hidden element
containing the tooltip’s content. The tooltip trigger (the child of `<Tooltip>`) receives an
`aria-describedby` attribute that links it to this hidden element.

- If `content` is a function: `aria-describedby` is provided as a prop.
- If `content` is a component: `aria-describedby` is added to the element in a `useEffect`.

To prevent the hidden element from being used for screen reader announcements, set the
`isScreenReaderAnnouncementDisabled` prop. This is helpful when the tooltip content is the same as
the trigger content, so no hidden element is needed.

Because keyboard shortcuts in tooltips are hidden from assistive technologies, always provide them
in another way, such as in a panel or dialog. This ensures everyone can discover and use shortcuts,
no matter how they navigate.

### Never use the title attribute

Don’t use the HTML `title` attribute on any children of the tooltip component. Using `title` can
cause double tooltips to appear and creates accessibility issues. The `title` attribute is not
reliably supported by screen readers, and it is inaccessible to keyboard-only and mobile users.

<Example Component={TooltipAvoidTitle} packageName="@atlaskit/tooltip" />

### Never put tooltips on disabled elements

Tooltips should only appear on interactive elements. Disabled elements can’t be reached by all
devices or assistive technologies, making their tooltips inaccessible.

Tooltips on disabled elements can also confuse users, disrupt navigation, and are difficult to use
on touch devices or with zoom magnification. People may not expect to find information by hovering
over disabled or non-interactive elements.

[avoiding disabled buttons](/components/button/usage#avoid-disabling-buttons).
