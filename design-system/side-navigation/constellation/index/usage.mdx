## Usage

The side navigation helps people move around within a subsection of an app. For example, navigating
through the topics in a Confluence space, or to specific tasks within their Jira project.

Use the side navigation with the [page layout component](/components/page-layout/examples) to
compose your navigation experience. This ensures that you get access to useful accessibility and
customization features by default.

## Accessibility

- Keep nested navigation levels to a minimum. If you need to use a nested navigation, always provide
  a "go back" button to help people get out of the menu.
- Provide a unique `label` for every different navigation in the page layout. Make sure that the
  navigation label is meaningful and not direction-based. For example, "Current project" not "Left
  navigation". If it's the same navigation repeated in another place on the page layout, use the
  same `label`.
- Don't include the word "navigation" in your `label`. The `<nav>` semantics mean assistive
  technology will already tell people that they are using a navigation.

## Best practices

### Loading states

Sometimes you'll need to load some of the side navigation content asynchronously. There are a few
things to keep in mind:

- Only use skeletons when you're certain of what the loaded state will look like. Most items that
  appear in side navigation are probably fine to use with skeletons, for example, `@atlaskit/tree`.
- When transitioning from loading skeleton to loaded items, try to ensure the jump doesn't look
  janky - use the equivalent skeleton item that is appropriate and be careful of things changing
  size by a few pixels. We should be striving for UI that feels **stable**, which means it doesn't
  jump around when content loads.
- Ensure loading does not take too long - try to anticipate if people will look at your menu via
  hover events and pre-load the data as soon as possible.
- When the content is loading in, make sure it all loads in at the same time - our minds aren't fast
  enough to distinguish each item loading individually, for example, and it appears slower to most
  people.
