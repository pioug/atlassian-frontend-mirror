description: An adapter that enables drag and drop operations on HTML elements.
---

import SectionMessage from '@atlaskit/section-message';

The element adapter enables drag and drop operations on HTML elements.

## The pieces

- `draggable`: marking that a `HTMLElement` can be dragged
- `dropTargetForElements`: marking an element as a valid drop target
- `monitorForElements`: listen for `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` element drag operation events anywhere
- `type`s: all types for this adapter

## Draggable

A `draggable` is an `HTMLElement` that can be dragged around by a user.

A `draggable` can be located:

- Outside of any drop targets
- Inside any amount of levels of nested drop targets
- So, anywhere!

While a drag operation is occurring:

- You can add new `draggable`s
- You can remount a `draggable`. See [Reconciliation](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/reconciliation)
- You can change the dimensions of the dragging `draggable` during a drag. But keep in mind that won't change the drag preview image, as that is collected only at the start of the drag (in `onGenerateDragPreview()`)
- You can remove the dragging `draggable` during a drag operation. When a `draggable` is removed it's event functions (eg `onDrag`) will no longer be called. Being able to remove the dragging `draggable` is a common requirement for virtual lists

### Draggable argument overview

- `element: HTMLElement`: a `HTMLElement` that will be draggable (using `HTMLElement` as that is the interface that allows the `"draggable"` attribute)
- `dragHandle?: Element`: an optional `Element` that can be used to designate the part of the `draggable` that can exclusively used to drag the whole `draggable`
- `canDrag?: (args: GetFeedbackArgs) => boolean`: used to conditionally allow dragging (see below)
- `getInitialData?: (args: GetFeedbackArgs) => Record<string, unknown>`: a one time attaching of data to a draggable as a drag is starting

```ts
type GetFeedbackArgs = {
  /**
   * The user input as a drag is trying to start (the `initial` input)
   */
  input: Input;
  /**
   * The `draggable` element
   */
  element: HTMLElement;
  /**
   * The `dragHandle` element for the `draggable`
   */
  dragHandle: Element | null;
};
```

- [`onGenerateDragPreview`](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events)
- [`onDragStart`](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events)
- [`onDrag`](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events)
- [`onDropTargetChange`](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events)
- [`onDrop`](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events)

### Drag handles

A _drag handle_ is the part of your `draggable` element that can dragged in order to drag the whole `draggable`. By default, the entire `draggable` acts as a _drag handle_. However, you can optionally mark a child element of a `draggable` element as the _drag handle_.

```ts
draggable({
  element: myElement,
  dragHandle: myDragHandleElement,
});
```

### Conditional dragging (`canDrag()`)

A `draggable` can conditionally allow dragging by using the `canDrag()` function. Returning `true` from `canDrag()` will allow the drag, and returning `false` will prevent a drag.

```ts
draggable({
  element: myElement,
  // disable dragging
  canDrag: () => false,
});
```

Disabling a drag by returning `false` from `canDrag()` will prevent any other `draggable` on the page from being dragged. `@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop` calls `event.preventDefault()` under the hood when `canDrag()` returns `false`, which cancels the drag operation. Unfortunately, once a drag event has started, a `draggable` element cannot individually opt out of dragging and allow another element to be dragged.

If you want to disable dragging for a `draggable`, but still want a parent `draggable` to be able to be dragged, then rather than using `canDrag()` you can conditionally apply `draggable()`

Here is example of what that could look like using `react`:

```ts
import {useEffect} from 'react';
import {draggable} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

function noop(){};

function Item({isDraggingEnabled}: {isDraggingEnabled: boolean}) {
  const ref = useRef();

  useEffect({
    // when disabled, don't make the element draggable
    // this will allow a parent draggable to still be dragged
    if(!isDraggingEnabled) {
      return noop;
    }
    return draggable({
      element: ref.current,
    });
  }, [isDraggingEnabled]);

  return <div ref={ref}>Draggable item</div>
};
```

### Drag previews

A _drag preview_ is the thing that a user drags around during a drag operation. We have a number of supported techniques for controlling what the _drag preview_ looks like.

### Native drag previews

Browsers have built in mechanisms for rendering a drag preview. We recommend using native drag previews where possible as they have great performance characteristics (they are not rendered on the main thread) and they can be dragged between applications.

There are a few techniques you can use to control what a native drag preview will look like:

#### Approach 1: Change the appearance of a `draggable`

If you do nothing, then the browser will use a picture of the `draggable` element as the drag preview. By leveraging event timings you can control the appearance of the drag preview that the browser generates:

1. in `onGenerateDragPreview` make whatever visual changes you want to the `draggable` element and those changes will be captured in the drag preview
2. in `onDragStart`:
   2a. revert changes of step 1. The user will never see the `draggable` element with the styles applied in `onGenerateDragPreview` due to paint timings
   2b. apply visual changes to the `draggable` element to make it clear to the user what element is being dragged
3. in `onDrop` remove any visual changes you applied to the `draggable` element during the drag

> [More information about how this technique works 🧑‍🔬](https://twitter.com/alexandereardon/status/1510826920023248900)

There are a few constraints imposed by browsers that you need to follow if you want to use this technique:

- Your `draggable` needs to be _completely_ visible and unobfiscated at the start of the drag. This can involve insuring that your `draggable` is not cut off by scroll (see `scrollJustEnoughIntoView`), and has no layers currently on top of the `draggable` (for example, you might need to close some popups)
- The users pointer still needs to be over the `draggable` after the changes you make to the `draggable` element in `onGenerateDragPreview`. Generally this means that you should not be changing the dimensions of the `draggable` element.
- Avoid CSS `transform` on your `draggable`. In Safari, CSS `transform`s that impact a `draggable` can mess up native drag previews.
  - [Bug 1](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=246734) when a `transform` impacts a `draggable` _before_ a drag starts:
  - [Bug 2](https://twitter.com/alexandereardon/status/1511148574943240194) when CSS `transform` is applied to a `draggable` element in `onGenerateDragPreview`

#### Approach 2: Use a custom native drag preview

You can ask the browser to take a photo of another visible element on the page and use that as the drag preview.

##### Mounting a new element

You can use `setCustomNativeDragPreview` to mount a new element to the page to be used as the drag preview. `setCustomNativeDragPreview` will call your `cleanup` function to remove the preview element from the page after the browser has taken a photo of the element. `setCustomNativeDragPreview` adds the `container` `Element` to the `document.body` and will remove the `container` `Element` after your `cleanup` function is called.

`setCustomNativeDragPreview` has been designed to work with any view abstraction

###### Usage example: `react` portals

This technique requires your component to be re-rendered, but maintains the current `react` `context`

```tsx
type State =
  | {
      type: 'idle';
    }
  | {
      type: 'preview';
      container: HTMLElement;
    };

function Item() {
  const [state, setState] = useState<State>({ type: 'idle' });
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    invariant(ref.current);

    return draggable({
      element: ref.current,
      onGenerateDragPreview({ nativeSetDragImage }) {
        setCustomNativeDragPreview({
          render({ container }) {
            // Cause a `react` re-render to create your portal synchronously
            setState({ type: 'preview', container });
            // In our cleanup function: cause a `react` re-render to create remove your portal
            // Note: you can also remove the portal in `onDragStart`,
            // which is when the cleanup function is called
            return () => setState({ type: 'idle' });
          },
          nativeSetDragImage,
        });
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      <div ref={ref}>Drag Me</div>
      {state.type === 'preview'
        ? ReactDOM.createPortal(<Preview />, state.container)
        : null}
    </>
  );
}
```

###### Usage example: A new `react` application

This technique requires no re-rendering of your component, but does not maintain the current `react` `context`

```tsx
import { setCustomNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/set-custom-native-drag-preview';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  onGenerateDragPreview: ({ nativeSetDragImage }) => {
    setCustomNativeDragPreview({
      render: function render({ container }) {
        ReactDOM.render(<Preview item={item} />, container);
        return function cleanup() {
          ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
        };
      },
      nativeSetDragImage,
    });
  },
});
```

###### Offset

You can control where the custom native drag preview is placed by using the `getOffset()` argument.

You can return an `{x: number, y: number}` object from `getOffset()` which will control where the native drag preview is rendered relative to the users pointer. `{x: 0, y: 0}` represents having the users pointer user the top left corner of the drag preview.

For clarity:

> `const rect = container.getBoundingClientRect()`

- `{x: 0, y: 0}` → top left of the `container` will be under the users pointer **(default)**
- `{x: rect.width, y: 0}` top right of the `container` will be under the users pointer
- `{x: rect.width, y: rect.height}` bottom right of the `container` will be under the users pointer
- `{x: 0, y: rect.height}` bottom left of the `container` will be under the users pointer

```ts
type GetOffsetFn = (args: { container: HTMLElement }) => {x: number, y: number};
```

Notes:

- `GetOffsetFn` needs to return `x` and `y` as numbers as that is what the platform requires
- You cannot use negative values (not supported by browsers). If you want to push the drag preview away from the users pointer, use `offsetFromPointer` (see below)
- The max offset value for an axis is the `border-box`. Values greater than the `border-box` get trimmed to be the `border-box` value

`{x: rect.width + 1, y: rect.height + 1}` effectively becomes `{x: rect.width, y: rect.height}`.



```tsx
import { setCustomNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/set-custom-native-drag-preview';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  onGenerateDragPreview: ({ nativeSetDragImage }) => {
    setCustomNativeDragPreview({
      // place the (near) top middle of the `container` under the users pointer
      getOffset: () => {
        const rect = container.getBoundingClientRect();
        return { x: rect.width / 2, y: 16 };
      },
      render: function render({ container }) {
        ReactDOM.render(<Preview item={item} />, container);
        return function cleanup() {
          ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container);
        };
      },
      nativeSetDragImage,
    });
  },
});
```

We have `getOffset()` helpers for `setCustomnativeDragPreview()`:

1. `centerUnderPointer`: centers the custom native drag preview under the users cursor

```ts
import { setCustomNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/set-custom-native-drag-preview';
import { centerUnderPointer } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/center-under-pointer';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  onGenerateDragPreview: ({ nativeSetDragImage }) => {
    setCustomNativeDragPreview({
      getOffset: centerUnderPointer,
      render: function render({ container }) {
        /* ... */
      },
      nativeSetDragImage,
    });
  },
});
```

2. `offsetFromPointer`: a cross browser mechanism to push the drag preview away from the users pointer

```ts
import { setCustomNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/set-custom-native-drag-preview';
import { offsetFromPointer } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/offset-from-pointer';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  onGenerateDragPreview: ({ nativeSetDragImage }) => {
    setCustomNativeDragPreview({
      // `x` and `y` can be any CSS value
      getOffset: offsetFromPointer({ x: '8px', y: 'calc(var(--grid) * 2)' }),
      render: function render({ container }) {
        /* ... */
      },
      nativeSetDragImage,
    });
  },
});
```

Note: if you are using css variables inside of your `getOffset()` you need to be sure your css variables are available at the `<body>` element, as the `container` is temporarily mounted as a child of `<body>`

### Non-native custom drag previews

In some situations, you might want to completely disable the native drag preview and render your own drag preview. The advantage of this technique is that you can update the drag preview during a drag. The downsides of this approach is that it is not as fast, and you cannot drag the non-native drag preview outside of a browser window.

To use this technique:

1. disable the native drag preview

```ts
import { disableNativeDragPreview } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/util/disable-native-drag-preview';

draggable({
  element: myElement,
  onGenerateDragPreview({ setNativeDragPreview }) {
    disableNativeDragPreview({ setNativeDragPreview });
  },
});
```

> This technique renders a `1x1` transparent image as the native drag preview. There are a few alternative techniques for hiding the drag preview, but this technique yielded the best results across many browsers and devices.

2. render your own element in `onDragStart` (ideally in a portal), and under the user's pointer (you can use `location.initial.input` to get the users initial position)
3. move the new element around in response to `onDrag` events (use `location.current.input` to get the users current pointer position)
4. remove the new element in `onDrop`

If you are doing this technique, you will likely want to use the `cancelUnhandled` _addon_. Using that addon will prevent the strange situation where when the user does not drop on a drop target there is a fairly large pause before the drop event. This is because the browser does a drop animation when the user does not drop on a drop target; a "return home" animation. Because you have hidden the native drag preview, the user won't see this return home drop animation, but will experience a delay. Using `cancelUnhandled()` ensures that the return home drop animation won't run

## Drop target for elements

A [drop target](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/drop-targets) for elements.

The default `dropEffect` for this type of drop target is `"move"`. This lines up with our [design guides](components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/design-guidelines/introduction). You can override this default with `getDropEffect()`.

```ts
import {dropTargetForElements} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = dropTargetForElements({
  element: myElement,
  onDragStart: () => console.log('Something started dragging in me!');
});
```

## Monitor for elements

A [monitor](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/monitors) for elements.

```ts
import {monitorForElements} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';

const cleanup = monitorForElements({
  onDragStart: () => console.log('Dragging an element');
});
```

## Source data

Each element adapter [event](/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/events) is given at least the following data:

```ts
type ElementEventPayloadMap = {
  location: DragLocationHistory;
  source: {
    element: HTMLElement;
    dragHandle: Element | null;
    data: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
};
```

You can get this type from the file adapter:

```ts
import type { ElementEventBasePayload } from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/element';
```

You can get payload types for all file events using the following types as well:

```ts
import type {
  // The type of the shared payload for events
  ElementEventBasePayload

  // A map of event names to expected payloads
  ElementEventPayloadMap,

  // A map of event names to expected payloads for drop targets
  ElementDropTargetEventPayloadMap,

  // A map of event names to expected payloads for monitors
  ElementMonitorEventPayloadMap,
} from '@atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/adapter/file';
```
