## Usage

Object icons represent an Atlassian-specific content type. They can trigger actions such as opening
a page in Confluence, a Jira work item, or a pull request in Bitbucket.

Unlike a standard icon, object icons help people identify the content type fast. This reduces
cognitive load for people across apps and platforms.

Object icons can be in:

- Search
- Media cards
- Smart cards
- Attachment uploads
- Activity feeds
- Inline links

## Best practices

### Color

Object icons are assigned specific colors. For consistency across apps, don’t change the color of
the object icon.

## Accessibility

- Use object icons in combination with a title and meta-information, such as author, creation date,
  or sub-heading.
- Pair object icons with [tooltips](/components/tooltip). On hover, the tooltip reveals the specific
  content type of the icon.
