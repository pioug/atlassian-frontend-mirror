description: A way to group related menu items.

Used to group related items in a menu, with an optional heading component. Generally you'll want to always group items in sections, even if there is only one item in the group; however a heading is not always necessary.

Internally this component contains a basic section component, optionally wrapped around a `HeadingItem` component. Children are rendered as siblings of the HeadingItem. This is done in a way to provide some added accessibility features (see 'Accessibility' below).

## Accessibility

When there are a large number of items in a menu, allowing users who navigate with a screen reader to skip over sections can greatly improve the user experience. This behavior is done by default with this component by setting a group role and label.

It may be necessary to manually set the `HeadingItem`; in these cases the below code provides an example of how to recreate this accessibility feature.

```jsx
import { Section } from '@atlaskit/menu';
import { HeadingItem } from '@atlaskit/menu';

<MenuGroup>
  <Section aria-labelledby="actions">
    <HeadingItem id="actions" aria-hidden>
      Actions
    </HeadingItem>
    <ButtonItem>Create article</ButtonItem>
  </Section>
</MenuGroup>;
```

The above is equivalent to the following code:

```jsx
import { Section } from '@atlaskit/menu';
import { HeadingItem } from '@atlaskit/menu';

<MenuGroup>
  <Section title="Actions">
    <ButtonItem>Create article</ButtonItem>
  </Section>
</MenuGroup>;
```
