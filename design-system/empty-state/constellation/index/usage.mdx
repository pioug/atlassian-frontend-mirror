## Usage

Empty states show when there is nothing to display in a view, for example, when a board has no
tasks, someone clears their inbox, or a search returns no results.

An empty state can appear as a full screen message or within panels, tables, and other containers.
Empty states can be a chance to celebrate, educate, and inform people of what they can do next.

## Anatomy

![The empty state component is made up of four parts that are center-aligned and stacked vertically: An illustration, a header, a description, and a button.](images/empty-state-anatomy.png)

1. **Illustration (optional)**: A spot illustration that relates to the message literally or as a
   metaphor (see illustration best practices below).
1. **Header**: A title that provides a concise description of the current state.
1. **Description (optional)**: A short message describing the reason for the state and what to do
   next. See content guidelines below for details.
1. **Buttons (optional)**: Next steps or a way to dismiss the message. Can be a primary button,
   secondary button, or link-styled button.

## Behavior

This component has two width options for containers of different sizes:

- The default width, `wide`, is 464px. This is based on six columns in the cozy grid system.
- The `narrow` size shrinks the text width to 304px. That's four columns in the cozy grid system.
  Use this for empty states in containers smaller than the default width.

The only required part of the empty state component is the heading, which uses h600 heading type. If
this doesn't fit your case, you may have to consider another component or custom design. See the
[grid](/foundations/grid/) and [typography](/foundations/typography/) foundations for more
guidelines.

## Accessibility

- Avoid jargon and use simple language.
- Make links descriptive of their destination.
- If the illustration provides useful information, include alternative text. If it's only for
  decoration, avoid alt text or remove the image altogether.

## Best practices

Include an action or link to help people understand what to do next.

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: ctaDoImage,
			alt: `An empty state with a single call to action to "Add files".`,
		}}
	>
		Include a relevant call to action.
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: ctaDontImage,
			alt: 'An empty state with multiple primary buttons on the page: "Add files" and "Use API"',
		}}
	>
		Include too many call to action buttons on one page.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

### Illustrations

- This component is optimized for spot illustrations. Don’t resize spot heroes or other larger
  illustrations to fit a smaller space.
- Make sure the image is relevant to the current task and context. Some spot images are designed
  specifically for empty states.
- Choose an image that has a neutral or humorous tone (never negative).
- Using an image as a metaphor may not translate to all cultures and languages. When choosing
  imagery, consider internationalization.
- Illustrations are optional. Consider leaving out the illustration if there are other visuals that
  might be competing on one screen, or if the space is too small for a spot illustration.
- If there isn’t a relevant illustration in the library, internal Atlassians can request one through
  the [illustration request process](http://go/custom-illustration).

<DoDontGrid>
	<DoDont
		type="do"
		image={{
			url: illustrationDoImage,
			alt: `An empty state with a call to action to "Create or import a repository" and a spot illustration of an open file.`,
		}}
	>
		Use a relevant spot illustration (optional).
	</DoDont>
	<DoDont
		type="dont"
		image={{
			url: illustrationDontImage,
			alt: 'An empty state with an image that looks squished in with other elements in a UI',
		}}
	>
		Resize illustrations to fit.
	</DoDont>
</DoDontGrid>

## Content guidelines

Consider all scenarios that could cause the empty state to occur, and use that to inform the tone of
your writing:

- The first time someone views an empty board (blank slate) might call for an inspirational,
  motivating, or educational tone.
- An empty state that appears when a user finishes all their tasks could have a more celebratory
  tone and illustration.
- A general no-result state (such as no search results) might be more neutral, but still motivate by
  showing next steps.

When crafting your message, see the
[Atlassian voice and tone principles for empty states](/content/designing-messages/empty-state/).

- Always use sentence case for titles and headings.
- Try to limit the number of words in the message as much as possible. Remember that most people
  scan text instead of reading everything.
- Keep call to action (CTA) buttons short, and use imperative verbs such as **Try**, **Remove**, or
  **Create** to describe what action people can take next.
- Be mindful of how many CTAs might appear on one page.
- Empty states are often an opportunity to teach or give more information, especially if it’s the
  first time a person sees a screen. Avoid sending people to another location for more reading where
  possible, but if it can't be avoided, use a tertiary action link.
- See all writing guidelines on
  [empty state CTAs](/content/designing-messages/empty-state/#call-to-action-cta).

- For very small spaces or situations where this component doesn’t fit, you may consider designing
  an empty state from scratch. See our [grid](/foundations/grid/) and

- Some error messages, such as not found errors, may also fit this component layout. If you use this
  component for an error message, follow the

  appropriate illustration.
