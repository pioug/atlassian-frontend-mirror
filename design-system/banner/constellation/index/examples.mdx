or to warn them that something is about to go wrong.

### Error

Use `error` banners to inform users something critical has happened and requires immediate
attention.

### Announcement

Announcement banners are used by admins who want to make a general announcement about the product.
These banners do not contain an icon.

<Example Component={BannerAnnouncement} packageName="@atlaskit/banner" />

ellipses.

For longer content that wraps, compose your banner with
[design token primitives](/foundations/spacing/primitives/) instead.
