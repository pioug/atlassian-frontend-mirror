## Responsive `css` or `xcss`

Utilize our media queries exposed in `css`, `styled`, or `xcss` as computed keys to build responsive UIs. Learn more about these media query exports in [usage](/components/primitives/responsive/usage).

### Using with `xcss`

Please use `xcss` whenever possible to ensure consistency and safety with style overrides. Read more at [xcss](/components/primitives/xcss)

<Example
  Component={XCSSExample}
  packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive"
/>

### Using with `css`

<Example Component={CSSExample} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/responsive" />

## Responsive primitives

Consider these shortcuts to writing your own custom media queries. Composing with our primitives will be far quicker and consistent to implement, but may result in excess DOM nodes.
