## Usage

Use text areas to let people enter long-form plain text that spans over multiple lines, in an area
that can expand in height. Text areas are normally used in
[forms](https://atlassian.design/components/form/examples).

## Anatomy

![The text area component is made up of three parts, a label that is left-aligned above the field input area, the input area, and helper text which appears below the input area.](images/anatomy.png)

1. ** Label: ** Indicates the information the text area requires.
2. ** Input area: ** This is where users enter text.
3. ** Helper text (optional): ** Use to provide extra information about the field or to give
   specific formats the text area will accept (for
   example: `Passwords must contain at least 8 characters`).

## Accessibility

- Always use a label and associate the label to the field properly so that the text area is
  accessible to assistive technology.
- Don’t use placeholder text. Make sure any critical information is communicated in the field label
  or helper text below the field. Search fields are the only exception, but only if they include a
  search icon and accessible label.

## Character counter

You can add a character counter to a text area. It shows people how many characters can be entered
and provides real-time feedback on characters used and remaining.

A counter can be set to show a maximum length, minimum length, and both a minimum and maximum
length.

## Content guidelines

- Write a clear, concise label and use helper text to clarify the field input. Don’t use placeholder
  text as it isn’t announced by assistive technologies and disappears when the field is selected.
- The label should be a noun string. For example, if the text area appears in a modal called “Create
  component”, the label for a description text area should only say “Description” and not repeat the
  modal’s title.
