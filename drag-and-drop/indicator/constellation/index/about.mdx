description: Displaying the hitbox information on drop targets
---

This package contains `react` components to display hitbox information. Hitbox information is usually generated by [`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox`](drag-and-drop/packages/hitbox). These packages use `@emotion/react` for styling.

You do not _need_ to use these packages to display hitbox information, they have been created for your convienance. These packages embody our [design guidelines](/components/drag-and-drop/design-guidelines)

- [`@atlaskit/drag-and-drop-hitbox/box`](/components/drag-and-drop/packages/indicator/box) displays a line relative to a _box_ (eg a `Card`)
- Trees (coming soon)
