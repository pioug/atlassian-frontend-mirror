## Usage

Use an avatar tag to label a person, agent, team, project or space for quick recognition and
navigation. For other UI objects, use a [tag](/components/tag/tag). Avatar tags can be rendered as
flat, as links, or with a close button.

Avatar tags support three types of avatars:

- User (`type = 'user'`): Represent individual users.
- Agent (`type = 'agent'`): Represent agents like Rovo.
- Other (`type = 'other'`): Represent teams, projects or spaces. Use `isVerified` to represent
  verified teams.

Avatar tags are designed so they can be displayed within a [tag group](/components/tag-group). Use a
tag group to control the layout and alignment for a collection of avatar tags.

## Anatomy

<Image
	src={avatarTagAnatomyLight}
	srcDark={avatarTagAnatomyDark}
	alt="Avatar tag anatomy diagram showing three types: user (round avatar), agent (hexagonal avatar with close button), and other (square avatar with verified badge). Labels indicate: 1. Name, 2. Avatar, 3. Close button, 4. Verified badge"
/>

1. **Name:** Displays the name of the person, agent, team, space or project.
2. **Avatar:** An image representing the entity. The shape varies by type: round for people,
   hexagonal for agents and square for teams, projects and spaces.
3. **Close button (optional):** Included if the tag has an `isRemovable` property. The button
   enables the tag to be dismissed by the user.
4. **Verified badge (optional):** Included if the tag has an `isVerified` property. Used to
   represent verified teams. Do not use for other avatar tags.

## Best practices

### Use the correct type for your content

Avatar tags are reserved for individual, agent, team, project or space avatars. Don't use them to
represent any other type of content and make sure you use them appropriately to ensure the correct
visual treatment.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: avatarTagDoLight,
		urlDarkMode: avatarTagDoDark,
		alt: 'Avatar tags showing: Brian Lin (user), Design team with verified badge (other), Jira agent (agent), Project-atlas (other), and Design space (other)',
	}}
>
	Use avatar tags exclusively for people, agents, project, space or team avatars.
</DoDont>
<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: avatarTagDontLight,
		urlDarkMode: avatarTagDontDark,
		alt: 'Tags incorrectly using avatar tags for general elements like spike, document, blog, design, and minor fix',
	}}
>
	Don't use avatar tags for other general elements like document categories.
</DoDont>

### Use avatar tags in moderation

Avatar tags increase the amount of cognitive noise, particularly when combined with other labeling
elements, so use them in moderation.

### Don't use avatar tags within user-generated text

Avatar tags are reserved for labelling and should not be used in place of content in user-generated
long-form text or prompts, such as in editor.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: avatarTag2DoLight,
		urlDarkMode: avatarTag2DoDark,
		alt: 'Avatar tags used correctly to label and categorise items in a details panel',
	}}
>
	Use avatar tag to label and categorise items.
</DoDont>
<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: avatarTag2DontLight,
		urlDarkMode: avatarTag2DontDark,
		alt: 'Avatar tags incorrectly used inline with user generated text in an editor',
	}}
>
	Don't use avatar tags in line with user generated text.
</DoDont>

## Content guidelines

Truncate names with an ellipsis if they exceed the component's maximum width and ensure the full
text is revealed with a tooltip on hover.
