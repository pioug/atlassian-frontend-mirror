# @atlaskit/progress-indicator

## 9.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`947ba5b11f0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/947ba5b11f0) - The component has undergone an internal refactor. The following changes need to be called out:

  - `styled-components` has been removed from the package in favour of `@emotion/core`.
  - The component now supports a `testId` prop in line with other Design System components. This can be used for automated testing.
  - Focus ring colors have been normalised to be the same across all appearance types of the component.

### Patch Changes

- [patch][d222c2b987](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/d222c2b987):

  Theme has been converted to Typescript. Typescript consumers will now get static type safety. Flow types are no longer provided.

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes **
  When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}` must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes **
  Color palettes have been moved into their own file.
  Users will need to update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

- [major][76299208e6](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/76299208e6):

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
