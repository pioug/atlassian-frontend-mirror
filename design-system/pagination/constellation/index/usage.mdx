## Usage

Use pagination when there are too many results to show on the one page, so the user isn't overwhelmed by too much information.

Pagination is commonly used for things like table listings, search results, and directories. What constitutes “too many results” can be influenced by:

- system load times
- amount of data in each entry
- screen space

Pagination is a control that sits at the bottom of the page and allows the user to easily move between each page.

## Anatomy

![Pagination anatomy](./images/pagination-anatomy.png)

1. **Previous and next:** Navigate backward and forward from the currently selected page.
2. **Page navigation:** Navigate to a specific page by selecting the page number.
3. **Truncation:** When a threshold of pages is reached, the list is truncated using an ellipsis.

## Best practices

- For smaller screens, it's best to show a maximum of seven pages (including the ellipsis).
- For larger screens, show a maximum of 14 pages (including the ellipsis).
