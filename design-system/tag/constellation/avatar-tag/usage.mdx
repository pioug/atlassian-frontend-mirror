## Usage

Use an avatar tag to label a person for quick recognition and navigation. For other UI objects, use
a [tag](/components/tag/tag). Avatar tags can be rendered as read-only, as links, or with a close
button.

Avatar tags are designed so they can be displayed within a
[tag group](/components/tag-group/tag-group). Use a tag group to control the layout and alignment
for a collection of avatar tags.

## Anatomy

<Image
	src={avatarTagAnatomyLight}
	srcDark={avatarTagAnatomyDark}
	alt="Avatar tag anatomy diagram showing: 1. Name (displays the name of the person), 2. Avatar (an image representing the person, this will always be round), and 3. Close button (optional), include if the tag has a isRemovable property. The button enables the tag to be dismissed by the user"
/>

1. **Name:** Displays the name of the person.
2. **Avatar:** An image representing the person. This will always be round.
3. **Close button (optional):** Include if the tag has a `isRemovable` property. The button enables
   the tag to be dismissed by the user.

## Best practices

### Only use avatar tags for people

Avatar tags are reserved for people. Don't use them to represent any other type of content.

<DoDont
	type="do"
	image={{
		url: peopleTagDoLight,
		urlDarkMode: peopleTagDoDark,
		alt: 'Avatar tags showing person names with avatars: Brian Lin, Bella Adams, Annie Clare, Andres Ramos, and Hina Aurora',
	}}
>
	Use avatar tags exclusively for people.
</DoDont>
<DoDont
	type="dont"
	image={{
		url: peopleTagDontLight,
		urlDarkMode: peopleTagDontDark,
		alt: 'Avatar tags used for non-people content: Spike, Design, Document, Blog, and Minor fix',
	}}
>
	Don't use avatar tags for object-oriented elements.
</DoDont>

### Use avatar tags in moderation

Avatar tags increase the amount of cognitive noise, particularly when combined with other labeling
elements, so use them in moderation.

## Content guidelines

Truncate names with an ellipsis if they exceed the component's maximum width and ensure the full
text is revealed with a tooltip on hover.
